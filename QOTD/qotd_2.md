Difficulty: Complex
Tech Stack: ArgoCD, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform
Question: Imagine you're using ArgoCD for GitOps deployments in a Kubernetes ecosystem spread over AWS and an on-premises data center. Over time, you notice that ArgoCD is hanging and not deploying updates for certain manifests, causing deployment delays. What steps would you take to diagnose and address this issue?
Hint: Consider the architecture of the system. How does ArgoCD interact with Kubernetes, AWS and the on-premises data center? How does it sync and track changes from the Git repository? You might want to examine the logs and conditions of the ArgoCD and Kubernetes pods, and review the cluster health and connectivity. Think about network issues, resource limitations, permissions, etc. It may not be a single issue and could be a combination of several factors, so explain how you'll isolate each potential cause.
Answer: I would approach diagnosing and fixing this issue by isolating potential causes and taking the following steps:

1. **Check ArgoCD and Kubernetes Pod Logs**: Helm hooks or erroneous manifests can cause hangs. ArgoCD provides high-detail logs accessible through `kubectl logs -n argocd <argocd-pod>`. Look for issues related to the problematic manifest. Comb the Application controller, repository server, and API server logs. Each log may provide insight into the root cause of the problem.

2. **Review ArgoCD Cluster Connectivity**: ArgoCD relies on constant connectivity to function correctly. Verify the connectivity to your Kubernetes API servers. - Use the "argocd cluster list" command to list clusters and "argocd cluster get" to check detailed information. If there are connectivity issues, your on-prem/AWS infrastructure or network restrictions are potential problems.

3. **Double-check Resource Configuration**: Insufficient resources can cause freezing. Confirm your ArgoCD pods have sufficient CPU and memory. You can use the Metrics Server or Kube-state-metrics to monitor these metrics.

4. **Confirm System and App Synchronization**: GitOps is all about syncing desired state from Git repositories to the cluster/s. Use "argocd app list" and "argocd app get" commands for reviewing synchronization status. Manifests failing to sync can be the culprit.

5. **Review IAM Roles and Permissions**: If only AWS is showing problems, IAM permissions are a possible culprit. Confirm that your AWS resources can properly interact with ArgoCD and nothing is hindering IAM roles.

Remember, the issue may due to a combination of several factors, so carefully analyze each layer, from the whole cluster down to the individual manifests.
