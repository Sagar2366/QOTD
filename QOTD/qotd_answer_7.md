Answer: 

1. **Validation**: The first step would be to validate the alert. I would try accessing the service through its exposed endpoint to see if it is indeed down.

2. **Examine Logs and Events**: If the service is down, I would start by looking at the Kubernetes events (`kubectl get events`) relevant to the front-end service. Then I'd look at the logs of the service's pods (`kubectl logs <pod-name>`). 

3. **Check Dependencies**: The issue could also reside in the underlying layers, such as the back-end services or databases. The dependency services need to be probed for their health status. 

4. **Grafana & Prometheus Metric Analysis**: The combination of Grafana (visualization) and Prometheus (metrics collection) is powerful for understanding system performance. Issues like cpu, memory usage spikes, or network latency can be diagnosed easily with Grafana dashboards. 

5. **Pinpoint and Resolve Issue**: Based on what I find, I would try to pinpoint the problem. For example, if it was a resource constraint, I may allocate more resources to that pod. Or, If there is a bug in the code, I may fix the bug and roll out an update.

6. **Post-Incident Analysis and Future Monitoring**: After resolving the issue, documenting a post-incident analysis is a good habit. It identifies the problem definitively, measures taken to resolve it, and steps for prevention in the future. 

To ensure system performance and monitoring in the future, I would:

- Set up **Alerting Rules** in Grafana to get timely notifications on potential threshold breaches and monitor critical resource metrics.
  
- Implement **health checks (Liveness, Readiness and Startup probes)** in the Kubernetes service specifications to ensure auto recovery of failing services.
  
- Use **Kubernetes built-in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** to automatically scale the number of pods based on observed CPU utilization or custom metric provided by Prometheus.
