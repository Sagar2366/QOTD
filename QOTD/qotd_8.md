\n Answer: To handle automatic scaling and fault tolerance, you can utilize AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). 

Youâ€™ll start by defining a Launch Configuration in Terraform, which will specify the AMI ID, instance type, and other details for instances. Then, you'll create an Auto Scaling Group using this configuration. ASGs manage creating, updating, and deleting instances based on the Launch Configuration. You'll specify a minimum and maximum number of instances, as well as desired capacity for this group. 

To handle scaling, ASGs use scaling policies. You can utilize target tracking scaling policies, which adjust the number of instances based on a specific CloudWatch metric like CPU usage or Network In/Out. If a metric goes above/below a threshold, ASGs will add/remove instances.

ASGs also replace unhealthy instances. If AWS deems an instance in an ASG as unhealthy (maybe due to a system check failure), the ASG will automatically terminate it and launch a new one to replace it.

For distributing incoming traffic and ensuring high availability, use Elastic Load Balancer. You may use either an Application Load Balancer for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, or a Network Load Balancer for TCP traffic. In the ELB target group, you'll specify the ASG. The Load Balancer will automatically distribute incoming traffic across the healthy instances within the ASG.

Use Terraform to provision and manage these AWS resources as Infrastructure as code. Here's an example of how to define these in your Terraform configuration:

```
resource "aws_launch_configuration" "example" {
  image_id = "ami-0c94855ba95c574c8"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "example" {
  desired_capacity = 2
  min_size = 1
  max_size = 5

  launch_configuration = aws_launch_configuration.example.id

  target_group_arns = [aws_lb_target_group.example.arn]
}

resource "aws_lb" "example" {
  load_balancer_type = "application"
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "exa \n
