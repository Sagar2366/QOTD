\n Answer: 

1. **AWS Infrastructure:** 
Start by setting up the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. Create public and private subnets for isolating resources and managing access. Then utilize Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for distributing incoming app traffic across multiple targets such as EC2 instances. 

2. **AWS Kubernetes Service (EKS):**
Use EKS to manage your Kubernetes architecture. Create multiple nodes and pods distributed across different Availability Zones for fault-tolerance. Use services to expose your applications running on Kubernetes.

3. **Containerization with Docker:**
Dockerize your application for consistency across different environments. Create Docker images and push them to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

4. **Deployment with Argo CD:**
Configure Argo CD for continuous deployment, syncing your Git repository (which houses the Kubernetes manifests for your application) with the actual state in your EKS cluster.

5. **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:**
Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your applications and Kubernetes itself. Create dashboards in Grafana to visualize these metrics.

6. **Storage:**
Use Amazon EBS for block-level storage volumes for your EC2 instances or Pods. For shared or concurrent access, use Amazon EFS.

7. **Scaling:**
Utilize Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to scale your application based on metrics like CPU usage. You can configure custom metrics in Prometheus and use them in HPA.

8. **Database Management:**
Use Amazon RDS for the database layer. Enable Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

9. **Cost Optimization:**
Leverage AWS Spot instances for your worker nodes. They are much cheaper when compared to on-demand instances. Just ensure that the architecture can handle occasional Spot instance reclaims.

10. **Disaster Recovery:**
For disaster recovery, perform regular backups of the application, Database, and K \n
