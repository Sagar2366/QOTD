Difficulty: Complex
Tech Stack: AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana
Question: Suppose you are given the task to design and build a fault-tolerant and scalable architecture for a heavily used multi-tier web application. We are planning to use AWS as our cloud infrastructure. The application needs to support Kubernetes for container orchestration, Docker for containerization, ArgoCD for GitOps, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and observability. Can you describe how you'd build this infrastructure and why you'd make those decisions? Be sure to touch upon networking, storage, scaling, database management, and cost optimization aspects too.
Hint: Take a step by step approach. Start with explaining how you'd set up the AWS Infrastructure (VPC, Subnets, Load Balancers, etc.), then move on to the Kubernetes architecture (Nodes, Pods, Services, etc.). Include containerization with Docker, deployment with ArgoCD, Monitoring setup with Prometheus and Grafana. Also, speak about storage (EBS/EFS), scaling (using K8s autoscaling based on metrics), database management (RDS), and cost-balance mechanism. Consider high availability and disaster recovery in your answer too.
