Difficulty: Complex
Tech Stack: AWS, Terraform
Question: A company is planning to migrate its on-premise infrastructure to the AWS cloud while ensuring minimal downtime and maintaining business operations consistently during this migration process. They are looking to automate this process using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to replicate their current on-premises setup in AWS. They've selected Terraform as their IaC tool of choice. 

As an experienced DevOps engineer, how would you approach this migration process using Terraform? Please consider factors such as the existing infrastructure's mapping to AWS services, making sure the transition is smooth with minimal downtime, and also ensuring the consistency of the infrastructure state. 

Hint: You could begin by assessing and documenting the current On-Premises environment and infrastructure, identifying which AWS services best map to the current services, and describing how Terraform can be used to create, modify, and manage these services. Discuss the use of Terraform state to ensure consistency, and consider strategies such as Blue/Green deployment to minimize downtime during migration.
Answer: 

The migration process using Terraform has to be undertaken with a well-detailed plan in order to ensure minimal downtime.  

1. Assessment and discovery: Initially, conduct a thorough assessment of the current on-premises environment. This includes understanding the architecture, software stacks, network topology and data requirements. Document this information including dependencies and interactions between services.

2. Mapping to AWS services: Identify AWS services that can replace existing on-premise services. For example, if the current set-up is using an SQL server, this can be replaced by Amazon RDS. Similarly, physical servers can be replaced by EC2 instances. AWS SCT can help automate schema conversion, and AWS DMS to migrate the data itself.

3. Replicate infrastructure in AWS using Terraform: Once we have an understanding of the current on-premises set up and know the mapping to AWS services, the next step is to use Terraform to model and provision the AWS infrastructure. Terraform configurations would be written for each of the AWS services identified, using resource blocks within configuration files. 

Terraform maintains a state file to keep track of the resources it manages. By keeping this state file in a shared storage like S3 and locking it using DynamoDB, it allows working in a team while avoiding conflicts, providing the consistency needed.

4. Testing: Once the infrastructure is in place in AWS, conduct comprehensive testing to ensure everything is working as intended.

5. Migration: Use a blue-green deployment strategy to migrate services with minimal downtime. This means having two environments (blue and green); the blue is the live environment, while green is idle. The migration is first done on the green environment, and once everything is tested and working, the traffic is routed from blue to green.

6. Continuous Monitoring and Management: Post-migration, ensure continuous monitoring and management of the new setup. AWS CloudWatc
