Difficulty: Moderate
Tech Stack: Docker, AWS
Question: You are working for a company that uses Docker for containerization and AWS as a cloud service provider. The Dockerized application is structured in a manner where multiple containers need to communicate with each other. Which AWS service will you use to manage these container communications and why? 
Hint: Consider a service in AWS that is specifically designed to handle Docker containers and allows multi-container Docker environments.
Answer: The ideal AWS service for managing communication between multiple Docker containers is the Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). Amazon ECS is a high-performance, highly reliable, infrastructure management service designed specifically for Docker containers. It allows you to easily run, stop, and manage Docker containers across a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

ECS enables you to establish a logical boundary for your resources and provides isolation for your workloads. It supports Docker networking and integrates with Amazon ECR for Docker image storage, so you can avoid the upfront installation and upkeep of your own infrastructure. 

Amazon ECS also supports the creation of Amazon ECR repositories and can pull images directly from them. ECS Tasks (a running instance of an Amazon ECS Task Definition) can communicate with each other within the same task and across tasks within a service. 

You can also decide on how your containers network with each other by specifying the network modes in your task definition. ECS supports four networking modes: none, bridge, host, and awsvpc, where the ‘awsvpc’ mode allows each ECS task to have its own network interface and its own IP address in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Diagram/Example: 

```yaml
{
  "family": "my-web-app",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "web",
      "image": "nginx",
      "cpu": 100,
      "memory": 500,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "hostPort": 80
        }
      ],
      "essential": true,
      "entryPoint": [
        "sh",
        "-c",
        "/usr/local/bin/my-app-script"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, each task will get its own IP address and network interface in a VPC due to the networkMode set to 'awsvpc'. This permits each Docker container to have full networking features, just like EC2 instances.
