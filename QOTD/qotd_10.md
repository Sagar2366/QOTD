Question: Describe a situation when you had to teach a team about a new technological development or process?

Answer: Just recently, I trained my team on the use of Docker for replicating our product's operating environment. Many members of my team were acclimated to older methods of environment setup, such as using virtual machines, and were initially skeptical about Docker. 

I organized a knowledge-sharing session to address this issue. I started by aiding them in understanding the basic concepts of containerization, and the differences between virtualization and containerization. I discussed the advantages of using Docker such as its light-weight nature, ensuring same development and production environment, and its ease of use.

Following that, I walked them through Docker terminology including Dockerfiles, images, and containers. I also covered common Docker commands like pull, run, build, stop and remove. I prepared a sample Dockerfile, explaining each step and its significance, and demonstrated the procedure for building an image from it and running the container.

When they were comfortable with the basics, I demonstrated how to containerize one of our simple applications. This practise clarified their understanding better and they began to see the value in Docker. I ended the training by showing them how to use Docker Compose to spin up multi-containers applications which are often the case in our projects.

I put up all these resources on our team's shared drive for future reference and pointed them to some online resources if they wish to learn more. Regular follow-ups were done to make sure they started adopting Docker in their everyday development tasks. The team was appreciative of this effort and they have been successfully using Docker since.
