Difficulty: Complex
Tech Stack: Kubernetes, AWS
Question: Let's say you have deployed a microservice architecture in Kubernetes hosted in AWS. You have Service A that communicates with Service B over HTTP. Service B is started after Service A, which causes Service A to fail because it cannot connect to Service B right away. What would you do to solve this problem without just increasing the initial delay on a readiness probe for Service A?
Hint: Think about how Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes work and how you can use them to ensure Service A is ready to accept traffic only after Service B is up and running. Also, consider the concept of "CrashLoopBackOff" state in Pod lifecycle.
Answer: The recommended way to solve this issue is to make Service A resilient to Service B's unavailability, whenever Service B is not up. This is done via implementing error handling and retry logic in Service A. 

The retry logic will help Service A to keep trying to connect to Service B instead of just failing when Service B is unavailable. A circuit breaker could also be utilized to prevent Service A from continuously trying to connect to Service B, which is particularly useful when Service B takes a long time to become available or is permanently down.

Another approach could be to use Kubernetes readiness and liveness checks. In this case, Service B's readiness probe should return a successful response before Service A starts. The liveness probe for Service A can be used to restart the Service A pod if it cannot connect to Service B, putting it into the "CrashLoopBackOff" state. This forces Kubernetes to restart the pod. 

With AWS, you can use Route 53 health checks or Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) health checks to ensure that Service B is fully healthy before routing any traffic from Service A.

This is preferable to just increasing the initial delay on the readiness probe for Service A, as it allows for better handling of unexpected network faults and Service B downtimes.

Diagram/Example: 

In the following Kubernetes probe example, a readiness probe is made to check if Service B’s HTTP endpoint is available within a timeout of 1 second. If not, the probe will fail and Service A will not start:

```
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 1
```

For the liveness probe, a check is made to Service A’s own HTTP endpoint, and if not successful, Kubernetes will restart the pod:

```
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 20
```
