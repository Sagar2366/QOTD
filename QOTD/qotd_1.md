Tech Stack: Docker, CI/CD, Jenkins
Question: Your company is shifting towards a microservices architecture and you have been directed to ensure an efficient Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using Docker and Jenkins. A colleague suggests using the 'Build, Ship and Run Any App Anywhere' Docker mantra to create a CI/CD pipeline. Can you describe step by step how you would set up this pipeline?
Hint: Go through each stage of the CI/CD pipeline — from source code management to deployment — and mention how Docker and Jenkins would aid you in each stage. Consider aspects such as creating Docker images, using Docker containers, Jenkins jobs, and the process of integration and deployment.

Answer: 

The following step-by-step procedure can be used to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Docker and Jenkins.

1. Source Code Management (SCM): Manage your code on a repository like GitHub. Jenkins can be integrated with it to initiate the CI/CD pipeline after commits.

2. Build: Set up Jenkins jobs to automatically check for updates on the SCM. Create a Dockerfile to define the environment for your microservice. It will specify the OS, dependencies, and instructions to build the application. Jenkins should execute a build by sending the Dockerfile to the Docker daemon which will build a Docker image. Handle compilation, unit tests, and static code analysis here.

3. Store Artifacts: Upload the successful build (Docker image) to a Docker registry like Docker Hub or a private registry for safekeeping and version control.

4. Ship: Jenkins retrieves the latest Docker image from the registry and pushes it to the servers.

5. Automated Testing: Run automated tests (integration, system, load tests) in the Docker containers. If they fail, return to the first step.

6. Deploy: Successful Docker images are deployed to production in Docker containers. Deployment strategies could be blue-green deployment or canary release.

7. Monitor: Set up monitoring and logging tools (like ELK stack or Prometheus) to ensure app stability and performance. 

Docker provides a consistent and reproducible environment which is crucial for testing. Jenkins utilizes this feature of Docker to carry out Continuous Integration, where the software is built and tested frequently, and Continuous Delivery, where the tested software is reliably and quickly pushed out to production.
