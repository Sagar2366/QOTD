Difficulty: Moderate
Tech Stack: Docker, CI/CD, Jenkins
Question: Your company is shifting towards a microservices architecture and you have been directed to ensure an efficient Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using Docker and Jenkins. A colleague suggests using the 'Build, Ship and Run Any App Anywhere' Docker mantra to create a CI/CD pipeline. Can you describe step by step how you would set up this pipeline?
Hint: Go through each stage of the CI/CD pipeline — from source code management to deployment — and mention how Docker and Jenkins would aid you in each stage. Consider aspects such as creating Docker images, using Docker containers, Jenkins jobs, and the process of integration and deployment.
