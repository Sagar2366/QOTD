Question: Imagine you are running a moderately complex application in a Kubernetes cluster, which includes 3 databases, 2 back-end services, and a front-end service. All services have been containerized using Docker and they're running smoothly. Suddenly, you receive an alert that your front-end service is not responding. Describe the process you would use to troubleshoot this issue, and the steps you would take to ensure the systemâ€™s performance and monitoring in the future.
Hint: Think about the tools and strategies involved in monitoring services in a Kubernetes cluster and how Grafana and Prometheus could be utilized. It's also helpful to describe a methodology for troubleshooting the problem, step-by-step.
